Ex #8a a program that tests some properties of number array
compile: g++ -Wall ex8a -o ex8a
run: ./ex8a
Complexity time: N^2 where N is the array size
you have to following options you have to choose from them
usage example:
1- fill array (Complexity time: N)
2- linear search (Complexity time: N)
3- bubble sort (Complexity time: N^2)
4- binary search (Complexity time: LOG(N))
5- occurrences (Complexity time: N)
6- print (Complexity time: N)
7- reverse print (Complexity time: N)
8- is not decreasing (Complexity time: N)
9- is palindrome (Complexity time: N)
10- left sum numbers (Complexity time: N^2)
11- unique numbers (Complexity time: N^2)
12- prime numbers (Complexity time: N^2)
13- end
